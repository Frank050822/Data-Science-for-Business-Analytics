We use K-Means to divide our customers into 4 different groups, and then marketing department employees can utilize this information to target the customers.  
2. Predict customer behavior for potential purchases
Regression: Based on customer personal information, we can predict how much money such customers would like to spend in the future. 
3. Create a product recommendation system
Classification: Based on customer personal information, we can predict which contract s/he may be interested in signing, so we can also target our customers with different   marketing strategies.
